# ðŸ‘¾ Shoot'em Up - CPULATOR (DE1-SoC ARMv7)

This repository contains a project completed for a university course on Introduction to Embedded Systems. It is a game developed in C for the DE1-SOC board (ARMv7). It was developed using the CPULATOR simulator (ARMv7) and later adapted to the real board, using peripheral mappings. Peripherals such as VGA, 7-segment displays, and push buttons, as well as the double-buffering technique, were used.
